<h1 align="center">Elite Rides</h1>

[Fairchild School Appointment App](https://kslg-appointment-app.herokuapp.com/) is for a fictitious school called Fairchild School, and allows Parents, Guardians, Carers to book a consultation with their childâ€™s Teacher. The App is responsive so Parent can book and Teachers can manage appointments on mobile and tablet devices.

# User Experience Design

I used the 5 Planes of UX to provide a conceptual framework.


# Strategy Plane:

## Target Audience:

- Target Audience: 
`Users` Parents, Guardians and Carers.
`Admin` Teachers.
`Super Admim` School IT Department / School Office Admins.

## Mission Objectives:

- To develop an `mvp (minimum viable product)` that allows `Users` to book appointments with `Admin` Teachers for parents evening and other consultations.
- The app must be simple, easy for parents to use and must be able to book an appointment in `less than three clicks`.
- `Super Admins` will have backend access to manage appointments for the Users and Admin.

### The Why:

- The school was using paper forms which becomes costly and is environmentally unfriendly.

## Ideas and Inspiration Mind Map
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/mindmap_1.png)
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/mindmap2.png)


## Colour Palette Ideas:
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/color_pallette_ideas.png)

## Content Strategy:

- Main functionality is to book an appointment with the child's teacher.
- The Teacher has thier own admin area to view appointments and accept the appointment.
- The booking form will be easy to get to via the top navigation header or from the CTA button on the homepage.


## Typography:
https://fonts.google.com/
Montserrat was used due to it's warm style and being easy to read. The are qualities found in most school websites.

# The Scope Plane:

## Functional Requirements:

1. Problem: The `User` needs to have direct access to the appointment form to make an appointment.

- Solution: Acces the form in `less than three clicks`.

2. Problem: `Users` must not be allowed to see other `User` appointments order to protect their sensitive data.

- Solution: Create an `Admin Area` so only Teachers can login and gain access.

3. Problem: `Users` need to be notified that thier appointment is confirmed.

- Solution: The `Admin` can accpect the appointment which then `sends a confirmtion email` to the `User`

4. Problem: If appointment is no longer needed then it need to be removed from the appointments list.

- Solution: The `Admin` can `delete appointment records` from the Admin Area.

5. Problem: The `Admin` accidentally click delete on the appointment.

- Solution: `Defensive Programming` put in place to ask the `Admin` to confirm deletion of the appointment. 

6. Problem: Harmful bots and malicious attackers could use the appintment form to crash the site.

- Solution: Implement a `CAPTCHA` to the form so human intervention is needed to submit the form.
  - CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of security measure known as challenge-response authentication. CAPTCHA helps protect the site from spam and automated scipts by asking the `User` to complete a simple test that proves you are human and not a computer trying to break into a password protected account.

  - A CAPTCHA test is made up of two simple parts: a randomly generated sequence of letters and/or numbers that appear as a distorted image, and a text box. To pass a the test and prove your human identity, simply type the characters you see in the image into the text box.

[Back to contents](#contents)

## Content Requirements:

- `Public` Homepage with hero text to explain what the app is for.
- `Public` Booking form for the `User` to create the appointment.
- `Public with Restrictions` Admin area to Teacher `Admin` to manage the appointments.
- `Public` Login Page
- `Private` Teacher `Admin` Register Page - **Not public facing page. This will be a private link shared to Teachers.**

[Back to contents](#contents)

## Interaction Design:

- All CTA (Call to Action) buttons will change colour to let the customers know that the buttons are clickable. 
- The `User` and `Admin` are notified for all changes to appointments and data.
- The `Admin` login state is reflected to the `Admin` on the front-end.
- The `User` recieves an email confirmation when the appointment have been accepted by the `User`.
- Both thr `Admin` and `User` and presents with alert messages when they trigger a certain action. i.e create an appointment, etc.

Using the MoSCoW prioritisation method to outline the importance of each requirement and what needs to be delivered in the MVP.

![Navbar](/documentation/readme_folder/images/navbar_mobile.png)
